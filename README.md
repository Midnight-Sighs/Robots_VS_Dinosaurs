# Robots_VS_Dinosaurs

Welcome to Robots vs Dinosaurs.  This is where you'll pick one or the other and try to bash them!  Let's be honest, the dinosaurs should win every time.

 A note:
    I severely struggled after a certain point here.  I was going good, writing things out but I was working backwards (from my smaller classes up to my larger ones.)  In putting it all together up and up, I kept getting lost in the .notation and what was where and I really started struggling.  I would fix one thing just to find that it messed up another.  Unfortuneately, I started struggling when I should have been in the home stretch.  So I scrapped it all.  Started from scratch, went slow, and just got something that worked that was "technically" correct.  BUT that was not up to my standards.  So to redo I go.

    My plan in reworking is to start small.  Add small changes that I think I can easily handle without ENTIRELY breaking what I have.  My first step will be to add defense and energy because that seems like simple calculating and variables.  //added stamina and a defense stat for each creature.  Defense is working, stamina is being calulated correctly but not currently being utilized.
